# Post install of fedora 42 workstation

## Contents
Programs I like to use. 
Since it is a regular task for me, making it a script was a must.

### Objectives
- [X] Install all programs I use
- [X} Tweak the system to my liking - WIP
- [X] Learning
- [ ] Maybe create a easier way to do it, without intervention
- [ ] A TUI with checkboxes would be nice

# Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/etbcf/post_install.git

```
```
cd ~/post_install

```
```
./main.sh

```

üòÅ And that's all, follow the instructions in the terminal
